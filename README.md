Smart Factory Energy Prediction Challenge
Problem Overview
You've been hired as a data scientist for SmartManufacture Inc., a leading industrial automation company. The company has deployed an extensive sensor network throughout one of their client's manufacturing facilities to monitor environmental conditions and energy usage.

The client is concerned about the increasing energy costs associated with their manufacturing equipment. They want to implement a predictive system that can forecast equipment energy consumption based on various environmental factors and sensor readings from different zones of the factory.
Dataset Description
The data comes from a manufacturing facility equipped with multiple sensors that collect environmental measurements. Each record contains:

Timestamp of the measurement
Energy consumption readings for equipment and lighting
Temperature and humidity readings from 9 different zones in the facility
Outdoor weather conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
Additional measurements and calculated variables

Specific Goals:
1. Analyze the provided sensor data to identify patterns and relationships between environmental factors and equipment energy consumption
2. Build a robust regression model to predict equipment energy consumption
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics
4. Provide actionable insights and recommendations for reducing energy consumption
